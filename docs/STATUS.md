# Status — cat_de_roman_esti

Last verified: 2026-10-11 — V1.8 qualified locally; V1.7 remains parked ([ADR-0188](adr/0188-park-v1-7-and-reset-content-loop.md)); four native rails and content gates pass ([ADR-0189](adr/0189-behaviour-bound-installed-content-authorities.md)).

- **GUI checkpoint:** core1.2 released; native7/current+candidate andfocusedMotion14 PASS; exact15 accepted/unapplied; deps64ea PASS. Fullnormalized replay/Node3/lint/unit/CSP/device/KIT_BUMP pending. Linuxsupervisor/worker paused.
- **GitHub Actions:** [ADR-0164](adr/0164-manual-github-actions.md), checked2026-10-05; required Go/Node dispatch, references opt-in, no hosted run.

## Current state

- Package **1.0.1** (lobby **V1.0.1**) hardens owner-requested mixed-age V1 on phones/desktop;
  independent review/decision [ADR-0159](adr/0159-v1-0-1-testing-hardening.md).
- 1.0.1: a 0-point loss is never a record; circuit daily intent is single-use (one resume
  notice; Intrusul/Perechi results offer the pending daily); Conexiuni/Intrusul/Perechi
  boards step 4/2/1 columns only; Lanț stacks its route on phones and Alchimie keeps long
  words whole on enlarged text. Lanț has "Începe alt lanț", an announced position and
  "salturi"; Cald sau Rece shows "Arată răspunsul" and rules below play.
- 1.0.1: a failed optional AccountBar renders nothing instead of a game error; the reserve
  loads at startup and reserve drift returns the game's JSON 503; `/` revalidates on
  every load; `/api/health` reports `version`. Quick-game tiles are display-capitalised
  (reviewed lowercase allowlist); server copy has diacritics and correct plurals.
- Ghiozdan→Capra cu trei iezi has reviewed approval/captions; both routes win; all120captions exact.
- A finite reviewed reserve excludes 20 pack rounds and three quick boards from new
  bundled selection. Archived records remain unchanged. Custom development overrides
  retain their previous unranked compatibility scope under ADR-0158.
- All 256 historical rejections/seven pending boards, V99 twelve research proposals
  (eight researched/four held) and V98 three recipe ideas retain their prior state.
- [Content skill](../.agents/skills/romanian-game-content/SKILL.md): refinement/discovery with independent gates.
- Decision/evidence: [ADR-0158](adr/0158-v1-testing-release.md),
  [release review](reviews/v1-testing-release/README.md), [Romanian tester guide](TESTARE_V1.md).
- **V1.8 qualified locally:** 30 reviewed items: 23 new concepts, six existing-owner input
  families and one directional link; +23 nodes/+93 links/+136 forms, zero new curated rounds.
  Leafă→Salariu; ogradă→Curte is a regional input; full non-colliding paradigms preserve owners.
  [Review](reviews/v1-8-everyday-core/README.md) and [pool](content-pool/v1-8-everyday-core/pool.json).
  Four native rails reconstruct exactly; owner-approved Cald assertions, HTTP1207 and API51 pass.
  Full native race has no new red versus main; managed SPA baseline failures remain unchanged.

## Verification

- 1.0.1 (2026-09-23): **2466 backend / 53 accounts**, **240 frontend**, lint/typecheck/build
  (119.78/120 KiB gzip), validators, reserve builder, docs and whitespace; **622/622** browser
  cases (Edge desktop/Pixel 7, no retries), plus 200 repeated Lanț recovery cases pass.
  V1 receipts: [1.0.0](reviews/v1-testing-release/verification.json), [1.0.1](reviews/v1-0-1-hardening/README.md).

## Selected Go backend

- [ADR-0162](adr/0162-select-go-production-backend.md): owner-selected Go-only production runtime;
  six games/mining, exploration/restores, metadata/OpenAPI, legal pages and SPA are native Go.
  Canonical launcher/Docker/anonymous profile have no Python serving process or fallback.
- Serving qualification: **1207 HTTP responses/runtime** match Django; all games and ten histories
  match frozen references; prior Go race/vet and retained Rust **55 tests** pass (linked proof).
- Fixed a shared frontend score-receipt race found by the Go two-tab browser gate: transaction time
  is sampled after Web Lock acquisition. **241 frontend cases**, lint/typecheck/build pass (119.78 KiB).
- **622/622 browser cases per runtime** pass; same-CPU HTTP [receipts](reviews/native-backends/README.md).
  Build/run/CI: [guide](NATIVE_BACKENDS.md); Go production [proof](reviews/go-production/README.md) passes.
- [ADR-0163](adr/0163-complete-native-go-accounts.md): optional accounts/OAuth/consent/private
  progress/verified rankings/curated history/erasure and pending proposals are now native Go.
  Username/password and configured Google/Facebook adapters use the shared MIT auth core.
  Production flags remain off. Sources/world require rebuild; engine replicas still need affinity.

## Production and next work

- Production: anonymous V1.0.1 **Go** `abe933779f04c46a32ff0194b5111e68086ba93f`, deployed
  2026-10-04 after all required [CI37208742166](https://github.com/DobosP/cat_de_roman_esti/actions/runs/37208742166) jobs passed.
  Native account/proposal code is shipped dormant; no Python serving runtime.
- Local **622/622 browser**,242 frontend assertions, account/game concurrency/race/vet and
  **1207 HTTP parity** pass. Candidate/public **151 requests each**, six games/exploration,
 28 asset/cache/HEAD proofs pass; current content/legal configuration and accountsoff verified.
- UID10001/read-only, healthy/zero restarts; fixedPCRE2 and zero fixableHIGH/CRITICAL image gate.
  Caddy/certificates/volumes preserved; previousGo+Python rollback profiles retained.
  [Complete rollout proof](reviews/go-completion/README.md). No provider/minor activation.
- Native source/tooling [ADR-0165](adr/0165-native-source-build-and-qualification.md): eight-source export,
  terminal180/body32/prefix1009/HTTP1207/smoke151/assets28 and operator/race/vet proofs pass; capture archived.
- [ADR-0166](adr/0166-native-content-operators-and-builder-rails.md): independent review/rollback/v2 rails pass.
  [ADR-0167](adr/0167-close-unread-bodies-on-early-refusal.md):13 TCP gates/32 body/1207 parity and strict scalar envelopes pass; auth unchanged.
  [ADR-0168](adr/0168-qualify-complete-native-toolchain.md): native qualification remains historical evidence.
- V1.3: [pool3integrated/5held](content-pool/v1-3-everyday-concepts/pool.json), [integration](reviews/v1-3-everyday-concepts/README.md); graph3/12/12 accepted/applied.
- **V1.7 parked** ([ADR-0188](adr/0188-park-v1-7-and-reset-content-loop.md)): `codex/content-v1-7` (local 3377a68, origin fba9498) and `codex/content-v1-7-qualification` are not merged; zero integrated growth. V1.8 is the qualified content; [ADR-0186](adr/0186-go-authoritative-content-validation.md) keeps Go/native JSON authoritative. Outcome: [pool](content-pool/v1-7-recognizable-content/pool.json); leafă was independently integrated via V1.8 as a full-paradigm Salariu input.
- **V1.8 contentrails GREEN** (verified 2026-10-11): all four rails reconstruct exactly and re-audit under the current binary; contentrails/contentbuild race tests pass.
  Owner-approved Cald assertions and all content gates pass; only known main `TestManagedSPA*` failures remain. [Procedure](CONTENT_LOOP.md), [ADR-0189](adr/0189-behaviour-bound-installed-content-authorities.md).
- Deferred to one reviewed content wave (each re-pins KG/pack/ranking digests): missing
  diacritics in some descriptions ("roman"/"român"), the false Toma Caragiu–Reconstituirea
  casting edge, generic-only Lanț `lt_personalitati_186`, off-theme single-board Conexiuni
  Limbă/Geografie Greu shelves, label spellings (Herta Müller, Mica Unire 1859); forced fallback Societate/Secundă and mixed Personalități predicates.
- Known limits: Alchimie Greu starts on shelves without a curated board can take seconds (a time cap would break deterministic dailies); older stored score details keep ISO dates
  but display as dd.mm.yyyy. The held Familie gradient and four spare concept slots remain.
## Doc map
- README/AGENTS: orientation; agent-map/testing: gates; ADRs (newest 0189), [content loop](CONTENT_LOOP.md), WORKLOG: history; [GUI motion preparation](reviews/gui-motion-baseline/README.md):29 provisional preview/69 focused checks;48 future cases UNEXECUTED; named-gate placement blocked.
